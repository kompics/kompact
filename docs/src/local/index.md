# Local Kompact

In this section we will introduce those features of Kompact in detail, which do not use the networking subsystem.

In particular, we will talk about different styles of [communication](communication/index.md), as well as Kompact's built-in [timer facilities](timers.md), before describing some of the advanced options for Kompact systems, such as [schedulers](schedulers.md), [logging](logging.md), and [configuration](configuration.md) in some detail.
